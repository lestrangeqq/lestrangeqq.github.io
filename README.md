# lestrangeqq.github.io
Site with some of my work. Mostly on russian.

It contains my scripts, especially:

# FootNotes.JS
Lightweight (4kb) script on pure JS, what creates footnotes in your article, and also list with all of this notes.
Very easy to implent, and also easy to use. Working example here https://lestrangeqq.github.io/footNotes.html , click on [1], [2] etc.
